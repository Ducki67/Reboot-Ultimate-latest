# Installation

1. Click the green "<> Code 🔽" button, and click "Download ZIP". Extract it using [WinRAR](https://www.rarlab.com/rar/winrar-x64-701.exe).
2. Open the project using your preferred build tools. (Recommended: Visual Studio Community 2022, C++). 
3. At the top, click the green "▶ Local Windows Debugger" Button. This will start to compile the code into a suitable .dll file. If you get a popup/"error", it's just because it can't run it as a .dll (you need to inject it into your og build to run it)
4. Go to C:\Users\YourPCUser\Downloads\Reboot-Ultimate-main\x64\Release, there will be a "Reboot Ultimate.dll file there."
5. Run the server using the Reboot Launcher/another launcher of choice.
6. (extra) If you are using Reboot Launcher, Go to settings, and find either "Reboot DLL", or "Gameserver DLL". Put the dll there.
